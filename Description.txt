# TASK - CRUD API
- You are part of a database development team using multi-threading to handle database request.
- An API request could be performing any of the following operations on the database:
	- CREATE: Add a new record to the database.
	- READ: Returns a copy of the all records in the database.
	- UPDATE: Update a specific record in the database given partial information, id and name, about the record and the new information, practicals and assignments,to update. Updates first match.
	- DELETE: Delete a specific record from the database matching the given information, partial/full. Delete first match.

# The various requests to be made are stored in different queues based on the operation type. For each operation:
	- There are n number of threads that handle the requests for that specific operation.
	- Requests perform operations on the shared database.
	- Only one thread may operate on the database at any given time.
	- The different operations are handled concurrently.
	- A request fails if the is no match, for UPDATE and DELETE, and the attempt attribute gets incremented.
	- If a request exceeds 2 attempts the request is deleted otherwise its added back to the operations queue.
	- Threads sleeps for random amount of time between 50 and 100ms after handling a request.
	- Threads will operate until all request are handled i.e. the respective operation queue is empty.

# The following output must be produced:
- When a thread is ready to handle a request (they are not sleeping):
	[Thread-Name] [Operator-Name] is waiting for request.
- If a thread completes a request successfully:
	[Thread-Name] [Operator-Name] success [request-info]
- If the request is a READ output the database records:
	[Thread-Name] [Operator-Name]
	_______________
	[record-1-info]
	[record-2-info]
	...
	[record-N-info]
	_______________
- If a thread does not complete a request successfully:
	[Thread-Name] [Operator-Name] failed [request-info]
- When a thread sleeps:
	[Thread-Name] [Operator-Name] is sleeping.
- Due to the concurrent nature of the program, many outputs may be interleaved,however there are a couple of basic rules to follow:
	– If there has been a ‘waiting’ output, there may not be another one until a‘success’ or ’failed’ and a ’sleeping’ output by the same thread.
	– A request must receive a ’success’ output before the effect reflects in the read operator output.

# Note
- You will have to get creative with handling threads, queues and locks.
- A general rule of thumb is that each queue should have their OWN lock when accessed.
- You may not REMOVE any given code.
- You may add as much code and as many classes as you deem necessary.
- Any locks used in the program will have to be written from scratch. i.e NO using javas pre-built locks.
- You may use any of Javas pre-built data structures.
- Any locks used must be FAIR
